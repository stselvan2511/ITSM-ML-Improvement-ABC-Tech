# ITSM-ML-Improvement-ABC-Tech
Our Predictive IT Service Management (ITSM) project aims to revolutionize incident management and resource planning at ABC Tech. Leveraging the power of machine learning, we have developed predictive models to enhance various aspects of ITSM processes, including ticket prioritization, incident volume forecasting, and automatic ticket tagging.
